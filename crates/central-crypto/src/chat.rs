//! Chat's end-to-end encryption (the beta.8 social design, §4).
//!
//! Every construction here works on bytes: a message's header and body are
//! opaque to it, so the header the sender signed is exactly the header a
//! recipient checks, with no canonical form to agree on. What the bytes
//! *mean* (who a conversation's members are, whether an id was seen before,
//! how long a body may be) is the caller's: the client core opens a message
//! with its key cache and its seen ids around this crate, and the gateway
//! checks a device statement and a reported message with it.
//!
//! The crate does no I/O and draws no randomness of its own. A caller hands
//! in an [`Entropy`]: the client fills it from the operating system, tests
//! from a seeded stream, which is what makes every output pinnable by a
//! known-answer test. It builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with no backend
//! for `getrandom`, because nothing in its graph asks for one.
//!
//! | What | Where |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | A device's keys, its id and its signed statement (§4.1) | [`DeviceSecrets`], [`device_id`], [`verify_device`] |
//! | Sealing a message for devices, opening it on one (§4.2) | [`seal`], [`open`], [`verify_message`] |
//! | Checking a reported message (§4.7) | [`verify_report`] |
//! | Records at rest under the vault key (§4.8), history file names | [`at_rest_seal`], [`at_rest_open`], [`history_name`] |
//! | Safety numbers (§4.4) | [`fingerprint`], [`safety_number`] |
//! | Base64 on the wire and in reports | [`b64`] |
//!
//! Secrets live in [`zeroize::Zeroizing`] buffers and are wiped when dropped;
//! no `Debug` output of this crate prints one.
