//! Records at rest (§4.8): the chat's state file and each history entry,
//! sealed under the device's vault key.
//!
//! A record is `n(24) ‖ XChaCha20-Poly1305(rest_key).encrypt(n, json,
//! aad = C_REST ‖ kind ‖ name)`. The kind and the file's own name are the
//! associated data, so a record moved into another file, or from history
//! into state, fails to open rather than being read there.
//!
//! From the crypto review, two additions to §4.8:
//!
//! - The vault key is never used directly: `rest_key` and the key that
//!   names history files ([`history_name`]) are two HKDF-SHA256 subkeys of
//!   it (`C_VAULT ‖ "rest"`, `C_VAULT ‖ "name"`).
//! - The nonce is synthetic: HKDF-SHA256 with the 24 drawn bytes as salt,
//!   `rest_key` as input and `C_REST ‖ "nonce" ‖ aad ‖ SHA-256(plain)` as
//!   info. The vault key lives as long as the device, so a repeated draw
//!   must not repeat a nonce for two different records.
//!
//! What a record doesn't have is freshness: an older copy of a file, put
//! back, opens. The state's seen ids then forget messages seen since, which
//! the gateway's own refusal of a duplicate id still covers for the
//! messages it holds.
