//! Seeded keys for tests on both sides of the wire: this crate's own
//! known-answer tests, the client core's conversations through a fake
//! gateway, and the gateway's end-to-end tests (device registration and
//! reports need real signatures).
//!
//! **Never for real keys.** [`Seeded`] is a deterministic stream: anyone
//! who knows the seed knows every key drawn from it. A real device draws
//! from the operating system.
